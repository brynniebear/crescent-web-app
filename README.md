## Intro
The Crescent Web App is a new version of a hackathon project built at the 2021 Girl Develop It Hackathon. The aim of this project was to build an accessible app that successfully integrates anatomy, body knowledge, and physicality to help users better understand their bodies.

Our current team of junior designers and developers is redesigning and redeveloping the Crescent Web App, while learning the ins and outs of bringing an app from idea to inception.
